# Synthesized Voice Box

Emulate speech within Second Life

## Background

This was a small research project to emulate speech within Second Life based. Just under sixty 8-bit sounds from the General Instrument SPO-256-AL2 were strung together to form words. With the existing limitations, speech was not fluid. The project was donated as open-source to Second Life's third anniversary and was in the SL3B vault at the time. As I became familiar with various techniques to push Second Life platform to its limits, I found ways to work around some of the limitations and improved the voice box to produce speech that could be understood.

# Allophones

The allophones are parts of speach that are stitched together to form words and pauses. There are a total of three sets in this repo - sounds, sam, and lewie. I'm uncertain of the difference between "sounds" and "sam". It may have just been 8-bit vs 16 bit, or a format of the audio before uploading into Second Life. However, "Lewie" is my own voice trying out all of the sounds in a monotone voice, and then normalized before converting to 8-bit PCM mono. The original sounds are unable to be retrieved, as the Second Life viewer only receives OGG formatted sounds in a higher bitrate.

# Allophone - SPO 1.0

The object, [Allophone - SPO 1.0](./Objects/Allophone%20-%20SPO%201.0/) appears to only be an object to offer the allphone sounds from the [sounds](./Allophone/sounds/) folder. It's included for archival purposes.
