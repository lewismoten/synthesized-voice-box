# Allophones

The allopones are parts of speach that are stitched together to form words and pauses. There are a total of three sets - sounds, sam, and lewie. I'm uncertain of the difference between sounds and sam. However, "Lewie" is my own voice trying out all of the sounds in a monotone voice, and then normalized before converting to 8-bit PCM mono. The original sounds are unable to be retrieved, as the Second Life viewer only receives OGG formatted sounds.

# Allophone - SPO 1.0

The object, [Allophone - SPO 1.0](./Objects/Allophone%20-%20SPO%201.0/) appears to only be an object to offer the allphone sounds from the [sounds](./Allophone/sounds/) folder.
