Summary
Speak like a robot. Make products talk.


Description

Using under 60 allophones (parts of speech) of 8-bit sounds, text is synthesized into a robotic voice. The open-source scripts allow you to type a message on a hidden channel and then have it converted to speech. This product is based off of the General Instrument SPO-256-AL2 chip.

Known Issues

Voice can still be choppy. Some parts of voice may not play at all. Residents who were not present during initial pre-loading of sounds may hear a delay in some sounds.

Background History

I was researching ways to bring voice into second life to have my products speak to residents. Currently, a separate sound needs to be uploaded for each voice over that the product speaks. With a generic method of using bits of sound to emulate voice, upload of sound clips only needed to be done once. The sounds could be played in a variation to simulate any word that I needed to have spoken.

The voice box became more of a toy due to its limitations. Speech did not sound fluid enough to be understood. It was choppy, and sometimes did not play specific sounds due to caching issues and lag. Some simulators had a very bad delay that rendered the voice box useless.

Rather than have the effort go to waste, I contributed my work as a gift to the residents of second life by placing the voice box into the SLBB3 vault. chat bots such as Eliza had renewed my interest in the voice box and brought about more tweaking.
